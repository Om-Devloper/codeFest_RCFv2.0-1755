                          uniting all 562 princely states of the country to
                          build the Republic of India.</span

                          October 31st, 2018, marked the inauguration of the
                          world’s tallest statue – the Statue of Unity, against
                          the backdrop of the dramatic Satpura and Vindhyachal
                          hills in Kevadia, Gujarat. The 182-metre (600 feet
                          aprox.) statue is dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai
                          Patel, the architect of independent India. The
                          colossal monument towers over River Narmada, a tribute
                          to India ‘from the people of Gujarat’ to the leader
                          who placed people’s welfare first. The Statue of Unity
                          overlooks the vast surrounds and the river basin of
                          the Narmada River and the sprawling Sardar Sarovar
                          dam. It stands on the Sadhu Bet hillock, connected by
                          a 300-metre bridge, which offers access from the
                          mainland to the statue.

                          <br /><br />As a part of an outreach programme for the
                          project, the state government had asked Indian farmers
                          to donate their used farming equipment to collect iron
                          needed for the statue of Sardar Patel. Eventually,
                          about 5000 tonnes of iron is believed to be collected.
                          Details of the construction and history of the leader
                          can be seen in an in-house museum, inside the statue.

The Valley of Flower began with 48,000 plants in 2016 and has now reached up to 22,00,000 plants. Besides the parks, several photo booths and selfie points have been developed to take back fond memories of the visit. The spot resembles a rainbow of flowers setup on earth.
            
            More than 300 types of flowers are grown in this garden. A right blend of ornamental flowers, trees, shrubs, herbs, climbers and creepers are planted along with various shades of foliage, which forms the green cover in this area
